  <p>I am going to get a norwegian buhund. Its a spitz type dog breed that the viking
  used to use to raid villages and hike through the snowy mountians. It has a thick coat
that can make it in any montana weather. They require at least two hours of exersise everyday
They live to please their owners and are easy to train. They adapt well to apartment living
and can be left alone. I can't wait! </p>
