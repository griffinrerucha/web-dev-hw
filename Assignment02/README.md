I choose to take this class in order to fulfill a graduation requirment for upper division electives. I also think of myself as a tech savy guy who wouldn't find this class too hard. I also wanted to increase my understanding of the internet and the wold wide web. Also I felt this class would be easy and wouldn't bog me down too much!

Some things I've learned in this class is what cookies and dsn are. Some things I hope to learn is internet security and how to make a website.
