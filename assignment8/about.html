<h1>why I choose this instructable</h1>
<p>I mostly choose it because just the other day I had to replace an inner tube for the first time.
It was a satisifying new experience that gave me confidence with bike repair. I would suggest all cyclists learn this at some pooint.
If you own a bike give it a shot! You will probally be able to figure it out if I could!</p>
